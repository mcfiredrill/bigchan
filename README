== Welcome to Bigchan

Bigchan is an imageboard written in Rails because tony moved and his parents
only have dial-up internet plus he can't even get broadband where he lives and
the only company that does offer broadband in the area won't answer his calls
or emails so he couldn't host fortchan anymore on his laptop. In addition,
prgmr is taking forever to set up their new hardware and aren't accepting any
new users. So fortchan.org is now hosted on Heroku. I had to learn rails and
write this imageboard though cause they don't allow php or perl apps on
heroku???!?!?
